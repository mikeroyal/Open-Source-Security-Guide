 * **Note:** SSL works by using a public key to encrypt data that's transferred over the SSL connection. Most Web browsers support
SSL, and many Web sites use the protocol to obtain confidential user information, such as credit card numbers. By convention, URLs that require an SSL connection start with “https:” instead of “http:.”
